        .controller('YourController', function(){
            this.images = [
                'images/image1.jpg',
                'images/image2.jpg'
            ];

</div>
```

## API

* `data`: This attribute is useful to set an array with all image's path.
* `on-delete`: This attribute is useful to delete an image from image's array. It has to receive a callback and this callback has to return a promise. If that promise returned was resolved, the image will be removed from array. But if that promise was rejected, nothing happens.
